## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: Employed to design and prototype the user interface, providing a visual blueprint for the final portfolio.
- **Git,GitHub**: Utilized for version control and collaborative code management, ensuring efficient tracking of changes and serving as a secure backup.
- **GitHub Project**:Implemented for organized project management, using issues to streamline workflow and monitor progress.
- **React**: Used for building the user interface and providing a dynamic user experience.
- **Styled-components**: Employed for styling components in a modular and efficient way.
- **React-Icons**:Integrated for its extensive library of high-quality icons, simplifying the addition of visually appealing elements to the application.
- **useContext**: Utilized for managing global variables, such as tracking the state of the menu and device screen.

## Challenges

| Challenge Description                         | Solution                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Header and Menu: Difficulty with media queries logic within React components| Utilized `window.innerWidth` to dynamically determine screen size, adapting styles for mobile devices. |

## Global State Management

Utilized `useContext` for global state management. In the specific use cases, like tracking the menu state or customizing styles based on the device screen and soon for light-dark mode and translation.

## Future Features

- **Translate Language**: Implement a language translation feature, enhancing accessibility and allowing users to view content in their preferred language..
- **Dark Mode**: Implement a night mode feature to enhance user experience in low-light environments.
- **Redux Integration**: Plan to integrate Redux for more advanced and centralized state management.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
## `npm run deploy`
for deploy on githubpage

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
